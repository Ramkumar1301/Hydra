                Unrivalled Precision Technology
Using magnetic motion sensing, the best available technology of its kind, the Razer Hydra’s compact base station can compute the exact location and orientation of controllers in your hands, down to a millimeter and degree. Combined with Razer-grade ultra-low latency, you get a fluid and unhindered experience that’s accurate and precise, like a mirror reflection of you in the game world.

Total Game Immersion
Play your PC games in a new way with motion sensing controllers that take you deeper into the game world by letting you interact and move in complete three dimensions. Attacking with your weapon of choice at any precise angle or throwing a grenade with the right force becomes as easy and intuitive as picking up your mobile to make a call.

Extensive PC Games Library Compatibility
Apart from Portal 2, the Razer Hydra is optimized for over 125 popular PC games right out of the box. No more waiting for scarce motion-compatible games. And with the future possibility for more downloadable game configurations and the ability to self-configure motion mapping to your specifications, the Razer Hydra is a versatile monster that plays virtually every game.
